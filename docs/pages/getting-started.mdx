# Getting Started

## Wallets

For a wallet to be EIP-5792 compliant, it must implement support for the four new RPC methods specified in the EIP.

* ### `wallet_getCapabilities`

  * Returns, per chain ID, the capabilities a wallet supports. An example of a capability is `atomicBatch`, which specifies that a wallet can submit multiple calls as part of a single transaction.

* ### `wallet_sendCalls`

  * Requests that a wallet submits a batch of calls. This method also supports communicating with a wallet about capabilities it supports. 

* ### `wallet_getCallsStatus`

  * Returns the status of a call batch that was sent via `wallet_sendCalls`. This method returns a subset of the fields that `eth_getTransactionReceipt` returns, excluding any fields that may differ across wallet implementations.

* ### `wallet_showCallsStatus`

  * Requests that a wallet shows information about a given call bundle that was sent with `wallet_sendCalls`.

See the [reference section](./reference/getCapabilities) for details on how these should be implemented.

## Apps

The easiest way for apps to start using EIP-5792 is to use Wagmi and the experimental EIP-5792 Wagmi hooks.

```ts twoslash [App.tsx]
// @filename: App.tsx
import React from 'react'
// ---cut---
import { useCapabilities } from 'wagmi/experimental'

function App() {
  const { data: capabilities } = useCapabilities() // [!code hl]
// @log:   {
// @log:     84532: {
// @log:       atomicBatch: {
// @log:         supported: true,
// @log:       },
// @log:     }  
// @log:   }

  return <div />
}
```

See the [Wagmi documentation](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useCapabilities) for more.
