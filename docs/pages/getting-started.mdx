# Getting Started

## Wallets

For a wallet to be EIP-5792 compliant, it must implement support for the four new RPC methods specified in the EIP.

* ### wallet_getCapabilities

  * Returns, per chain ID, the capabilities a wallet supports. An example of a capability is `atomicBatch`, which specifies that a wallet can submit multiple calls as part of a single transaction.

* ### wallet_sendCalls

  * Requests that a wallet submits a batch of calls. This method also supports communicating with a wallet about capabilities it supports. 

* ### wallet_getCallsStatus

  * Returns the status of a call batch that was sent via `wallet_sendCalls`. This method returns a subset of the fields that `eth_getTransactionReceipt` returns, excluding any fields that may differ across wallet implementations.

* ### wallet_showCallsStatus

  * Requests that a wallet shows information about a given call bundle that was sent with `wallet_sendCalls`.

See the [reference section](./reference/getCapabilities) for details on how these should be implemented.

## Apps

The easiest way for apps to start using EIP-5792 is to use Wagmi and the experimental EIP-5792 viem actions.

```ts twoslash
import { useWalletClient } from 'wagmi'
import { walletActionsEip5792 } from 'viem/experimental'
 
const { data: walletClient } = useWalletClient()

if (walletClient) {
  const client = walletClient.extend(walletActionsEip5792())
  const capabilities = await client.getCapabilities()
// @log: {
// @log:   8453: {
// @log:      atomicBatch: {
// @log:        supported: true,
// @log:      },
// @log:    }
// @log: }
}
```
