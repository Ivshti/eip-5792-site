  * `string`
  * The version of the `sendCalls` API to use. Currently, '1.0' is the only version.

* ### calls
  * `Call[]`
  * The calls to submit. A `Call` is defined as an object that has the following fields:
    * to (optional)
      * `Address`
      * The address to send this call to. This field is optional because a call can be a contract creation.

      * Value in wei to send with this call.
    * data
      * `Hex`

## Returns

* `[string]`

A call bundle identifier. This identifier is only meant to be used with the `wallet_getCallsStatus` and `wallet_showCallsStatus` RPC methods, so apps should not assume that this string is a transaction hash or any other specific type of identifier.
