## Parameters

* `[string]` 

An array with a single element: a call bundle identifier returned by a `wallet_sendCalls` call.

## Returns

* ### status
  * `PENDING` | `CONFIRMED`
  * The status of the call bundle.

* ### receipts
  * `Receipt[]`
  * The receipts associated with a call bundle. This could be one receipt if a wallet supports submitting multiple calls as part of a single transaction. The `receipts` here are a subset of a full transaction receipt and are defined as an object with the following fields:
    * logs
      * `Log[]`
      * The logs generated by a call (or call bundle if executed atomically). Note that these should only be the logs associated with the call bundle. For example, an ERC-4337 wallet that submits multiple calls as a user operation should respond to this method with logs relevant only to that user operation. It should not include other logs that might have been included in the transaction submitted by a bundler.
    * status
      * `0x1 | 0x0`
      * `0x1` for success, `0x0` for failure
    * blockHash
      * `Hash`
      * Hash of the block where this call (or call bundle if executed atomically) was in.
    * blockNumber
      * `Hex`
      * Block number where this call (or call bundle if executed atomically) was in.
    * gasUsed
      * `Hex`
      * The amount of gas used by this call (or call bundle if executed atomically).
    * transactionHash
      * `Hash`
      * Hash of the transaction this call (or call bundle if executed atomically) was executed in.
