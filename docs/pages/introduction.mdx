## What is EIP-5792?

EIP-5792 introduces new JSON-RPC methods for communication between apps and wallets.

These new RPC methods unlock the ability for apps to make use of features available in newer wallets. For example, submitting multiple onchain calls as part of a single transaction or sponsoring users' transactions via ERC-4337 paymasters.
